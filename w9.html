          <p>Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.</p>
          <p><strong>Future developments.</strong> For the latest information about developments related to Form W-9 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to <a class="no-decor" href="http://www.irs.gov/FormW9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>www.irs.gov/FormW9</i></a>.</p>
          <h3>Purpose of Form</h3>
          <p>An individual or entity (Form W-9 requester) who is required to file an information return with the IRS must obtain your correct taxpayer identification number (TIN) which may be your social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or employer identification number (EIN), to report on an information return the amount paid to you, or other amount reportable on an information return. Examples of information returns include, but are not limited to, the following.</p>
          <ul  style="list-style-position: inside;padding-left: 0;">
            <li>Form 1099-INT (interest earned or paid)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div style="width: 50%;">
          <ul style="list-style-position: inside;padding-left: 0;">
            <li>Form 1099-DIV (dividends, including those from stocks or mutual funds)</li>
            <li>Form 1099-MISC (various types of income, prizes, awards, or gross proceeds)</li>
            <li>Form 1099-B (stock or mutual fund sales and certain other transactions by brokers)</li>

            <li>Form 1098 (home mortgage interest), 1098-E (student loan interest), 1098-T (tuition)</li>
            <li>Form 1099-C (canceled debt)</li>
            <li>Form 1099-A (acquisition or abandonment of secured property)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Use Form W-9 only if you are a U.S. person (including a resident alien), to provide your correct TIN.</p>
          <p>If you do not return Form W-9 to the requester with a TIN, you might be subject to backup withholding. See What is backup withholding, later.</p>

            <li>Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee. If applicable, you are also certifying that as a U.S. person, your allocable share of any partnership income from a U.S. trade or business is not subject to the withholding tax on foreign partners' share of effectively connected income, and</li>
            <li>Certify that FATCA code(s) entered on this form (if any) indicating that you are exempt from the FATCA reporting, is correct. See What is FATCA reporting, later, for further information.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are a U.S. person and a requester gives you a form other than Form W-9 to request your TIN, you must use the requester’s form if it is substantially similar to this Form W-9.</p>
          <p><strong>Definition of a U.S. person.</strong> For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S. person if you are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;</li>
            <li>A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States;</li>
            <li>An estate (other than a foreign estate); or</li>
            <li>A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7).</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Special rules for partnerships.</strong> Partnerships that conduct a trade or business in the United States are generally required to pay a withholding tax under section 1446 on any foreign partners’ share of effectively connected taxable income from such business. Further, in certain cases where a Form W-9 has not been received, the rules under section 1446 require a partnership to presume that a partner is a foreign person, and pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a U.S. person that is a partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your U.S. status and avoid section 1446 withholding on your share of partnership income.</p>
          <p>In the cases below, the following person must give Form W-9 to the partnership for purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding withholding on its allocable share of net income from the partnership conducting a trade or business in the United States.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the case of a disregarded entity with a U.S. owner, the U.S. owner of the disregarded entity and not the entity;</li>
            <li>In the case of a grantor trust with a U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner, generally, the U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner of the grantor trust and not the trust; and</li>
            <li>In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust), the U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries of the trust.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Foreign person.</strong> If you are a foreign person or the U.S. branch of a foreign bank that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person, do not use Form W-9. Instead, use the appropriate Form W-8 or Form 8233 (see Pub. 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities).</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Nonresident alien who becomes a resident alien.</strong> Generally, only a nonresident alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as a “saving clause.” Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the payee has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.
          </p>
          <p>If you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the following five items.</p>
          <ol>

            <li>The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.</li>
            <li>The treaty article addressing the income.</li>
            <li>The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the saving clause and its exceptions.</li>
            <li>The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax.</li>
            <li>Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the treaty article.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div style="width: 50%;">
          <p><strong>Example.</strong> Article 20 of the U.S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S.-China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first protocol) and is relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on his or her scholarship or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the information described above to support that exemption.</p>
          <p>If you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity, give the requester the appropriate completed Form W-8 or Form 8233.</p>
          <h3>Backup Withholding</h3>
          <p><strong>What is backup withholding?</strong> Persons making certain payments to you must under certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS 24% of such payments. This is called “backup withholding.” Payments that may be subject to backup withholding include interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter exchange transactions, rents, royalties, nonemployee pay, payments made in settlement of payment card and third party network transactions, and certain payments from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to backup withholding.</p>
          <p>You will not be subject to backup withholding on payments you receive if you give the requester your correct TIN, make the proper certifications, and report all your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return.</p>
          <p class="fw-bold">Payments you receive will be subject to backup withholding if:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>You do not furnish your TIN to the requester,</li>
            <li>You do not certify your TIN when required (see the instructions for Part II for details),</li>
            <li>The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an incorrect TIN,</li>
            <li>The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you did not report all your interest and dividends on your tax return (for reportable interest and dividends only), or</li>
            <li>You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup withholding under 4 above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened after 1983 only).</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Certain payees and payments are exempt from backup withholding. See Exempt payee code, later, and the separate Instructions for the Requester of Form W-9 for more information.</p>
          <p>Also see Special rules for partnerships, earlier.</p>
          <h3>What is FATCA Reporting?</h3>
          <p>The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires a participating foreign financial institution to report all United States account holders that are specified United States persons. Certain payees are exempt from FATCA reporting. See Exemption from FATCA reporting code, later, and the Instructions for the Requester of Form W-9 for more information.</p>
          <h3>Updating Your Information</h3>
          <p>You must provide updated information to any person to whom you claimed to be an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt payee and anticipate receiving reportable payments in the future from this person. For example, you may need to provide updated information if you are a C corporation that elects to be an S corporation, or if you no longer are tax exempt. In addition, you must furnish a new Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account; for example, if the grantor of a grantor trust dies.</p>
          <h3>Penalties</h3>
          <p class="mb-0">Failure to furnish TIN. If you fail to furnish your correct TIN to a requester, you are subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.</p>
          <p><strong>Civil penalty for false information with respect to withholding.</strong> If you make a false statement with no reasonable basis that results in no backup withholding, you are subject to a $500 penalty.</p>

          <p>If this Form W-9 is for a joint account (other than an account maintained by a foreign financial institution (FFI)), list first, and then circle, the name of the person or entity whose number you entered in Part I of Form W-9. If you are providing Form W-9 to an FFI to document a joint account, each holder of the account that is a U.S. person must provide a Form W-9.</p>

            <li><strong>Individual.</strong> Generally, enter the name shown on your tax return. If you have changed your last name without informing the Social Security Administration (SSA) of the name change, enter your first name, the last name as shown on your social security card, and your new last name.
            <p><strong>Note: ITIN applicant:</strong> Enter your individual name as it was entered on your Form W-7 application, line 1a. This should also be the same as the name you entered on the Form 1040/1040A/1040EZ you filed with your application.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Sole proprietor or single-member LLC.</strong> Enter your individual name as shown on your 1040/1040A/1040EZ on line 1. You may enter your business, trade, or “doing business as” (DBA) name on line 2.</li>
            <li><strong>Partnership, LLC that is not a single-member LLC, C corporation, or S corporation.</strong> Enter the entity's name as shown on the entity's tax return on line 1 and any business, trade, or DBA name on line 2.</li>
            <li><strong>Other entities.</strong> Enter your name as shown on required U.S. federal tax documents on line 1. This name should match the name shown on the charter or other legal document creating the entity. You may enter any business, trade, or DBA name on line 2.</li>
            <li><strong>Disregarded entity.</strong> For U.S. federal tax purposes, an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner is treated as a “disregarded entity.” See Regulations section 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iii). Enter the owner's name on line 1. The name of the entity entered on line 1 should never be a disregarded entity. The name on line 1 should be the name shown on the income tax return on which the income should be reported. For example, if a foreign LLC that is treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax purposes has a single owner that is a U.S. person, the U.S. owner's name is required to be provided on line 1. If the direct owner of the entity is also a disregarded entity, enter the first owner that is not disregarded for federal tax purposes. Enter the disregarded entity's name on line 2, “Business name/disregarded entity name.” If the owner of the disregarded entity is a foreign person, the owner must complete an appropriate Form W-8 instead of a Form W-9. This is the case even if the foreign person has a U.S. TIN.</li>

          <h4>Line 6</h4>
          <p>Enter your city, state, and ZIP code.</p>
          <h3>Part I. Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)</h3>
          <p><strong>Enter your TIN in the appropriate box.</strong> If you are a resident alien and you do not have and are not eligible to get an SSN, your TIN is your IRS individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN). Enter it in the social security number box. If you do not have an ITIN, see How to get a TIN below.</p>
          <p>If you are a sole proprietor and you have an EIN, you may enter either your SSN or EIN.</p>
          <p>If you are a single-member LLC that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner, enter the owner’s SSN (or EIN, if the owner has one). Do not enter the disregarded entity’s EIN. If the LLC is classified as a corporation or partnership, enter the entity’s EIN.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> See What Name and Number To Give the Requester, later, for further clarification of name and TIN combinations.</p>
          <p><strong>How to get a TIN.</strong> If you do not have a TIN, apply for one immediately. To apply for an SSN, get Form SS-5, Application for a Social Security Card, from your local SSA office or get this form online at www.SSA.gov. You may also get this form by calling 1-800-772-1213. Use Form W-7, Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, to apply for an ITIN, or Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, to apply for an EIN. You can apply for an EIN online by accessing the IRS website at www.irs.gov/Businesses and clicking on Employer Identification Number (EIN) under Starting a Business. Go to www.irs.gov/Forms to view, download, or print Form W-7 and/or Form SS-4. Or, you can go to www.irs.gov/OrderForms to place an order and have Form W-7 and/or SS-4 mailed to you within 10 business days.</p>
          <p>If you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a TIN and write “Applied For” in the space for the TIN, sign and date the form, and give it to the requester. For interest and dividend payments, and certain payments made with respect to readily tradable instruments, generally you will have 60 days to get a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup withholding on payments. The 60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be subject to backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to the requester.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> Entering “Applied For” means that you have already applied for a TIN or that you intend to apply for one soon.</p>
          <p><strong>Caution:</strong> A disregarded U.S. entity that has a foreign owner must use the appropriate Form W-8.</p>
          <h3>Part II. Certification</h3>
          <p>To establish to the withholding agent that you are a U.S. person, or resident alien, sign Form W-9. You may be requested to sign by the withholding agent even if item 1, 4, or 5 below indicates otherwise.</p>
          <p>For a joint account, only the person whose TIN is shown in Part I should sign (when required). In the case of a disregarded entity, the person identified on line 1 must sign. Exempt payees, see Exempt payee code, earlier.</p>
          <p><strong>Signature requirements.</strong> Complete the certification as indicated in items 1 through 5 below.</p>

        <h3>Secure Your Tax Records From Identity Theft</h3>
        <p>Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information such as your name, SSN, or other identifying information, without your permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. An identity thief may use your SSN to get a job or may file a tax return using your SSN to receive a refund.</p>
        <span>To reduce your risk:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Protect your SSN,</li>
          <li>Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and</li>
          <li>Be careful when choosing a tax preparer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your tax records are affected by identity theft and you receive a notice from the IRS, respond right away to the name and phone number printed on the IRS notice or letter.</p>
        <p>If your tax records are not currently affected by identity theft but you think you are at risk due to a lost or stolen purse or wallet, questionable credit card activity or credit report, contact the IRS Identity Theft Hotline at 1-800-908-4490 or submit Form 14039.</p>
        <p>For more information, see Pub. 5027, Identity Theft Information for Taxpayers.</p>
        <p>Victims of identity theft who are experiencing economic harm or a systemic problem, or are seeking help in resolving tax problems that have not been resolved through normal channels, may be eligible for Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) assistance. You can reach TAS by calling the TAS toll-free case intake line at 1-877-777-4778 or TTY/TDD 1-800-829-4059.</p>
        <p><strong>Protect yourself from suspicious emails or phishing schemes.</strong> Phishing is the creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business emails and websites. The most common act is sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft.</p>

        <h3>Privacy Act Notice</h3>
        <p>Section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you to provide your correct TIN to persons (including federal agencies) who are required to file information returns with the IRS to report interest, dividends, or certain other income paid to you; mortgage interest you paid; the acquisition or abandonment of secured property; the cancellation of debt; or contributions you made to an IRA, Archer MSA, or HSA. The person collecting this form uses the information on the form to file information returns with the IRS, reporting the above information. Routine uses of this information include giving it to the Department of Justice for civil and criminal litigation and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. commonwealths and possessions for use in administering their laws. The information also may be disclosed to other countries under a treaty, to federal and state agencies to enforce civil and criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism. You must provide your TIN whether or not you are required to file a tax return. Under section 3406, payers must generally withhold a percentage of taxable interest, dividend, and certain other payments to a payee who does not give a TIN to the payer. Certain penalties may also apply for providing false or fraudulent information.</p>
