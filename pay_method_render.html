                <p>Our Pay Card program provides a dependable, safe and very convenient way to receive your pay. You can get your pay through ATM withdrawal, make purchases at stores, and get cash back with those purchases, or even transfer money to a personal or joint checking account. No waiting to get your check, no waiting to cash your check, just use your card to start spending your money. Every employee is eligible for the pay card program. There is no application and no approval process. Any fees for using the card are listed in your enrollment packet.</p>
                <p>I select the Pay Card program to receive my pay. I hereby authorize FIELDWORKS to initiate credit entries for my net pay to the program. If funds to which I am not entitled are deposited to my account, I authorize debits to my account and return of such funds. This authority is to remain in effect until FIELDWORKS has received notification from me of its termination in such time and such manner as to afford FIELDWORKS a reasonable opportunity to act on it or until FIELDWORKS cancels the agreement.
