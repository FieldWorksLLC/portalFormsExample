              <p>Arizona law requires your employer to withhold Arizona income
                tax from your wages for work done in Arizona. The amount
                withheld is applied to your Arizona income tax due when you
                file your tax return. The amount withheld is a percentage of
                your gross taxable wages from every paycheck. You may
                also have your employer withhold an extra amount from each
                paycheck. Complete this form to select a percentage and any
                extra amount to be withheld from each paycheck.</p>
              <div>
                <h3>What are my “Gross Taxable Wages”?</h3>
                <p>For withholding purposes, your “gross taxable wages” are the
                  wages that will generally be in box 1 of your federal Form W-2.
                  It is your gross wages less any pretax deductions, such as your
                  share of health insurance premiums.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>New Employees</h3>
                <p>Complete this form within the first five days of your employment
                  to select an Arizona withholding percentage. You may also
                  have your employer withhold an extra amount from each
                  paycheck. If you do not give this form to your employer the
                  department requires your employer to withhold 2.0% of your
                  gross taxable wages.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Current Employees</h3>
                <p>If you want to change your current amount withheld, you must
                  file this form to change the Arizona withholding percentage or
                  to change the extra amount withheld.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>What Should I do With Form A-4?</h3>
                <p>Give your completed Form A-4 to your employer.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Electing a Withholding Percentage of Zero</h3>
                <p>You may elect an Arizona withholding percentage of zero
                  if you expect to have no Arizona income tax liability for the
                  current year. Arizona tax liability is gross tax liability less any
                  tax credits, such as the family tax credit, school tax credits, or
                  credits for taxes paid to other states. If you make this election,
                  your employer will not withhold Arizona income tax from your
                  wages for payroll periods beginning after the date you file the
                  form. To keep this election for the next calendar year, you must
                  give your employer an updated Form A-4. If you do not, your
                  employer may withhold Arizona income tax from your wages
                  and salary until you submit an updated Form A-4.</p>
                <p>Zero withholding does not relieve you from paying Arizona
                  income taxes that might be due at the time you file your Arizona
                  income tax return. If you have an Arizona tax liability when
                  you file your return or if at any time during the current year
                  conditions change so that you expect to have a tax liability, you
                  should promptly file a new Form A-4 and choose a withholding
                  percentage that applies to you.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Voluntary Withholding Election by Certain
                  Nonresident Employees</h3>
                <p>Compensation earned by nonresidents while physically
                  working in Arizona for temporary periods is subject to Arizona
                  income tax. However, under Arizona law, compensation paid
                  to certain nonresident employees is not subject to Arizona
                  income tax withholding. These nonresident employees need
                  to review their situations and determine if they should elect to
                  have Arizona income taxes withheld from their Arizona source
                  compensation. Nonresident employees may request that their
                  employer withhold Arizona income taxes by completing this
                  form to elect Arizona income tax withholding.</p>
