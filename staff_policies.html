          <h2>Welcome to the FieldWorks Team!</h2>
          <p> If you have any questions about the following policies, please ask your Office Director.</p>

          <p>Please make sure you read these policies, as they will govern important terms and conditions of your
          employment by FieldWorks, LLC (FieldWorks).</p>

          <h2>Training</h2>
          <p>Your job is fairly simple and you will get better with practice. On your first day, you will begin with a
          training. In this training, we give you detailed instructions on how to complete your work. You will also
          receive information about the issues we’re working on and we will describe the typical day on the job. During
          your first shift, you will also work with one of our staff members who will provide guidance and feedback
          while you are at your work location.</p>

          <p>Training is ongoing after your first day, and you will continue to learn new skills and information about the
          issues. You are required to participate daily in skills sessions and briefings. This is a critical function to
          meeting individual as well as office performance goals.</p>

          <h2>Schedule</h2>
          <p>The office is generally open every day. There will be several different shifts available each week which will
          be announced in the office. At the conclusion of each shift, you will be asked to confirm your schedule for
          the next scheduled shifts. Most canvassers will work full time, but part time work is also available. You have
          flexibility in choosing your workdays and some flexibility in choosing your shift.</p>

          <h2>Breaks</h2>
          <p>You are entitled to a paid 15-minute rest break for every four hours worked during your shift. You are
          entitled to an unpaid 30-minute meal break for every five hours worked during your shift. If your shift
          includes a meal break, the full 30-minute meal break will be accounted for and deducted from your time worked
          regardless of whether or not you took the full meal break. You may leave your assigned work site during these
          breaks if you wish, but we are not responsible for your transportation during this time.</p>

          <h2>Term of Employment</h2>
          <p>You are an employee at will. That means your employment can be terminated by FieldWorks or by you for any
          reason or no reason, at any time. In no event will your employment last longer than the project for which you
          are employed. Upon termination of your employment for any reason, you will not be entitled to severance or any
          other payment or benefits except as set out specifically in these written policies.</p>

          <h2>Pay</h2>
          <p>You are being hired as a non-exempt employee, and appropriate taxes and other required deductions will be
          withheld and state new hire reporting will be completed. Your pay will be based on your professionalism, work
          ethic, punctuality, overall job performance and the level of responsibility and leadership you take on in the
          office.</p>

          <p>You will be paid from the time you check-in on the time system with a director until the time you check out on
          the time system with a director, with reductions for any unpaid meal breaks. You should not do any work before
          you are checked in or after you are checked out. Make sure you are checked-in for any time you are working,
          even if it is outside of the normal schedule.</p>

          <p>The pay period is Sunday to Saturday each week. Paychecks and wages statements will be available after 5 PM
          the Friday immediately following each pay period. FieldWorks encourages you to sign-up for direct deposit or
          pay card in order to have your weekly pay transmitted directly to your bank or pay card rather than having to
          wait for a paper check. A replacement fee of $25 per check for any paper checks that need replaced will be
          deducted from the replacement check.</p>

          <p>FieldWorks takes paying employees correctly and timely very seriously. If you feel there has been a mistake in
          your pay, please speak to your Office Director and immediately complete a payroll correction form if there is
          an error. If you do not feel like your issue has been adequately resolved by your Office Director, please fill
          out our online form at <a href="http://payroll.fieldworks.com">http://payroll.fieldworks.com</a> or contact our national payroll office at 855-603-9729.</p>

          <h2>Overtime</h2>
          <p>You are not eligible to work more than 40 hours in one pay period without advance authorization from your
          Office Director. Since you have flexibility in choosing your own schedule, you have responsibility for
          ensuring you do not work more than 40 hours in one pay period.</p>

          <h2>Attendance</h2>
          <p>You are expected to be present on time for shifts for which you are scheduled and to work the entire shift. If
          you need to miss a day of work for an expected reason, you are required to give the director at least 24 hours
          notice. If you need to miss a day of work for an unexpected reason, you are required to give the director at
          least two hours notice before the beginning of the scheduled shift. Failure to properly notify the director of
          an expected absence or emergency may result in termination.</p>

          <h2>Tardiness</h2>
          <p>Shifts will start promptly at the scheduled time. If you are not present in the office at the scheduled start
          time, you may not be allowed to work that shift. If you know you are going to be late, call your Office
          Director to reschedule to a different shift before the shift begins.</p>

          <h2>Sick Leave</h2>
          <p>FieldWorks will provide up to 40 hours of paid sick leave to all employees each calendar year paid at your
          regular hourly rate. Sick leave will be accrued at the rate of one hour per every 30 hours worked starting on
          the first date of employment. Sick leave may be used beginning on the 90th calendar day after the commencement
          of your employment. Your available sick leave balance will be provided on your weekly wage statement. You are
          permitted to use your sick leave in increments of one-tenth of an hour (0.1).</p>

          <p>Sick leave is defined as when you are ill or require medical treatment and unable to come to work. It also
          includes time to assist a family member with a medical appointment or illness, or to deal with domestic abuse,
          harassment, sexual assault, or stalking. Other uses are allowed if covered by law. Covered family members
          include your spouse, same-gender domestic partner, biological child, adopted child, stepchild, foster child,
          same-gender domestic partner’s child, parent, adoptive parent, stepparent, foster parent, parent-in-law,
          same-gender domestic partner’s parent, grandparent, and grandchild.</p>

          <p>All employees are protected from coercion, intimidation, discrimination, and retaliation for using sick time.
          Coercion, intimidation, discrimination, and retaliation are not tolerated at FieldWorks.</p>

          <p>You should notify your Office Director in advance for each day of sick leave unless in an emergency. For
          emergency situations, you may only take sick leave for days you were scheduled to work. Report the emergency
          sick leave to your Office Director as soon as possible. Regardless of the situation, the deadline to request
          sick leave is the day that you return to work. If for some reason you do not return to work after your sick
          leave, the deadline to report your sick leave is the last day that the office is open or one week after your
          missed shift, whichever comes sooner.
          Unused sick leave may be rolled over each year at the rate of 48 hours per year up to a maximum of 88 hours in
          total. Unused sick leave will not be paid out upon termination. If you leave employment with FieldWorks and
          subsequently are re-employed within 12 months of separation, the accrued sick time balance you had upon
          separation will be restored and you may use accrued sick time after the combined total of days in the last 12
          months of employment reaches 90 calendar days.</p>

          <h2>Medical/Dental/Vision Insurance</h2>
          <p>FieldWorks offers medical, dental, and vision insurance. You are eligible for insurance coverage after 3
          months of full-time employment. Employees who work at least 130 hours in a month are considered full time.</p>

          <p>FieldWorks offers two levels of medical plan. One plan you will pay 40% and another which you pay 50%. This
          will be deducted from your pretax wages each week.</p>

          <p>You must complete the Employee Election Form within 3 days of your eligibility to either accept or decline
          coverages. Your coverage will be effective as of the first day of your eligibility. You can make changes by
          submitting an updated Employee Election Form. Changes can only be made within the first 30 days of
          eligibility, during our open enrollment period in March, or if you have a qualifying life event.</p>

          <p>Your coverage will be effective until your last day of employment. Upon separation from the company, you will
          receive notification by mail about COBRA coverage. You will have the option to either end coverage or extend
          by paying 100% of the cost</p>.

          <h2>Work Locations and Travel</h2>
          <p>You may not leave your assigned work area without informing and getting permission from your team leader or
          director in advance, except during authorized rest or meal breaks. You must travel directly to and from your
          work locations and the office. You are required to use the form of transportation assigned to you by your
          director. If you are not able to work your entire shift or need to leave your work site early, FieldWorks
          provided transportation may not be available prior to the end of your scheduled shift.</p>

          <p>If you are asked to leave your work area by an authority figure, move to the closest safe location and call
          your Office Director immediately. If you feel your work area is unsafe, move to the closest safe location and
          call your Office Director immediately or call 911 if it is an emergency.</p>

          <h2>Performance Standards</h2>
          <p>All staff are expected to meet basic performance standards. Performance standards are posted in the office and
          are included in the Office Policies. Performance standards may be changed during the course of the campaign.</p>

          <h2>Script and Recording of Data</h2>
          <p>You will be provided a script and instructions for use in completing your job duties. You must use the script
          and instructions at all times. You will also be required to record the results of your work in real time on a
          device. Failure to record results of your work in real time on the device may result in termination.</p>

          <h2>Fraud</h2>
          <p>If at any time you are proven or suspected of fraud you will be terminated. Additionally, we may forward
          evidence of your fraud to the proper authorities. Fieldworks has a zero-tolerance policy pertaining to fraud.
          Fraud includes but is not limited to: lying or misrepresenting yourself or the campaign, forging or falsifying
          any written or electronic information including the time of recorded events, completing an incorrect batch
          form covering your time or locations worked, or participating or encouraging in any activities that are
          against the law.</p>

          <h2>Team Leaders</h2>
          <p>Some canvassers may be promoted to a team leader position in the office. Team leaders manage crews of 3-5
          other people each day and will work closely with the director to improve the overall office performance. Team
          leaders must maintain excellent work ethic and performance. Team leaders will take on additional
          responsibility during the work shift. Team leaders are not authorized to work additional hours or outside of
          the standard shifts, with the exception of an initial one-hour training and a weekly 1 hour meeting with the
          director and other team leaders, and individual weekly meetings with your Office Director. The pay and
          standards for team leaders are different than that for canvassers. Details on team leader pay can be found in
          the Office Policies.</p>

          <h2>Driving</h2>
          <p>You may never drive your personal vehicle for work at any time. FieldWorks takes driving safety very
          seriously. A single complaint about unsafe driving may cause you to never be allowed to drive for FieldWorks
          again. You are personally responsible for the safe, proper, and legal use of a vehicle while driving for
          FieldWorks.</p>

          <p>Use of cell phones or other handheld devices while operating a FieldWorks vehicle is prohibited.</p>

          <p>Drivers will be provided a rented or leased vehicle to drive during their assigned shifts. Vehicles may be
          used only for authorized FieldWorks business.</p>

          <p>If you are authorized to get a FieldWorks rental car in your name, you will be held personally responsible for
          loss, damage, or theft of that vehicle. You can never smoke or have pets in a rental car. You may not ever
          operate a FieldWorks rental car before your employment begins of after your employment ends.</p>

          reimbursement of parking or tolls must be in writing and signed by your Office Director in advance. FieldWorks
          will not be responsible for speeding tickets or other infractions of the law, nor for any accidents or damage
          involving a vehicle you are operating. FieldWorks does not reimburse for any insurance deductibles.</p>

          against any and all costs, damages, and liability for death, injury to person, injury or damage to property
          and any other damages, costs, losses, or expenses of whatsoever nature, caused during or by reason of the
          possession and/or operation of any vehicle in the course or scope of employment by FieldWorks.</p>

          agents from and against any and losses, costs, damages or liability (including attorneys’ fees) arising from
          or related to any claim asserted by any third party for injury or damage to that third party or their
          property, resulting from or arising as a result of or in connection with the operation or possession of any
          vehicle by you in the course or scope of your employment by FieldWorks.</p>

          <h2>Driver Compensation</h2>
          <p>If you are a driver for FieldWorks during your shift you will receive an additional $10 per shift that you
          drive on your regular paycheck. You will not be reimbursed for mileage. You will only be allowed to drive and
          receive the additional compensation if you are asked to do so by your Director and agree to drive yourself and
          other staff.</p>

          <h2>Vehicle Accidents</h2>
          <p>You must immediately notify FieldWorks of any accident that occurs in connection with the use of any vehicle
          on FieldWorks time, or with a FieldWorks rental car at any time.</p>

          FieldWorks office or rental car, is strictly prohibited. You may never operate a vehicle during your shift if
          you have used alcohol, marijuana, illegal drugs, or other substances that might impact your ability to drive
          prior to operation.</p>

          <h2>Tobacco</h2>
          <p>The use of tobacco during your shift, or at any time in a FieldWorks office or rental car, is strictly
          prohibited. Use of tobacco while on authorized rest or meal breaks is allowed provided it is not done in the
          assigned work location or in view of citizens you are supposed to contact.</p>

          <h2>Safety</h2>
          <p>You will be alone during most of your work shift. You are required to keep your FieldWorks issued phone on and
          accessible at all times except when on authorized rest or meal breaks. You may not enter any private homes,
          vehicles, or other non-public places at any time during your shift. You may not accept anything from citizens
          including but not limited to food and beverages.</p>

          <p>If you feel your work area is unsafe, move to the closest safe location and call your Office Director
          immediately or call 911 if it is an emergency.</p>

          <p>Our offices are equipped with video and audio recording devices for the protection of our employees and
          clients. By entering the office, you consent to being recorded.</p>

          <p>We are committed to a violence-free work environment and we will not tolerate any level of violence or the
          threat of violence in the workplace. Under no circumstances should anyone bring a weapon to work. If you
          become aware of a violation of this policy, you should report it to your Office Director immediately. If you
          are concerned of potential harm to a person, contact 911 immediately.</p>

          <p>You are responsible for securing personal items during your shift both in the field and while in the office.
          FieldWorks is not responsible for lost or stolen items.</p>

         <p> You will be on your feet for most of your shift. Your footwear should provide you an appropriate level of
          protection from rolling or falling objects, being pierced by objects, slipping on wet surfaces, and other
          hazards.</p>

          other such devices for transportation during your shift.</p>

          <p>If there is inclement weather during your shift, move to a safe area and contact your Office Director for
          instructions.</p>

          <h2>Professional Conduct</h2>
          <p>All employees should always respect their colleagues and behave in a professional manner. Remember that your
          actions in the office, during travel to/from work locations, and while in the field (even on your break) are a
          reflection of the campaign. Actions including lying, shouting, name calling, arguments or confrontations,
          insubordination, offering or accepting bribes, harassment, bullying, and other aggressive behaviors are
          unacceptable and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. All interactions with your
          Office Director, coworkers, clients, and the public should be conducted in a professional manner.</p>

          <h2>Equipment</h2>
          <p>You may be assigned equipment to carry out your responsibilities. All equipment should be used for FieldWorks
          duties only and must be returned at the end of each shift. No personal usage of equipment, including office
          computers and internet, is permitted. You will be financially responsible for any lost, stolen, or damaged
          equipment. Replacement costs for equipment will be deducted directly from your next paycheck as allowed by
          law.</p>

          <h2>Terminations and Resignations</h2>
          <p>Many states require payment of final wages prior to the regularly scheduled pay date for employees who are
          terminated or resign. If you are working in a state that requires payment prior to the next regularly
          scheduled pay date, you agree and acknowledge that for this final payment you may be provided by a pay card
          that includes your final wages. If you did not previously enroll in pay card as your method of payment, you
          will receive an additional reimbursement of $15 to cover any fees you might incur as a result of using the
          card. If you resign from your position, you must provide notice to the director. If you haven’t been on the
          schedule or clocked in for a shift in 3 weeks and aren’t scheduled for a future shift, we will consider this
          job abandonment and terminate your position.</p>

          <h2>Injuries</h2>
          <p>In the event that during the course of your work you become injured, you must notify your director
          immediately. If you need emergency medical services you should call 911 immediately, follow their
          instructions, and then contact your director.</p>

          <p>If you are injured during the course of your work, you must complete the Injury Report which you will be
          provided. You must report all injuries to your Office Director. You must complete the Injury Report
          immediately.</p>

          <h2>Law Enforcement Interaction</h2>
          <p>In the event that during the course of your work you encounter law enforcement personnel that question, delay,
          impede, or otherwise alter your standard work schedule and activities you must notify your director
          immediately. You should immediately comply with law enforcement requests. Once you have complied and are safe,
          if possible, attempt to ask for law enforcement to speak with your supervisor or collect information about the
          officer and their department.</p>

          <h2>Equal Opportunity</h2>
          <p>FieldWorks provides equal opportunity to all qualified employees, and applicants for employment, without
          regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, marital status, sexual orientation, veteran
          status, handicap, disability, or participation in protected union activity. This includes, but is not limited
          to: hiring and promotion, pay and other forms of compensation, benefits (including training and social
          programs), making reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), work force
          reduction or termination.</p>

          <p>FieldWorks is fully committed to making any reasonable accommodation that would allow an otherwise qualified
          person to perform the essential functions of a job. Requests for a reasonable accommodation should be made to
          the Director in writing, or to the National Office by filling out our form at <a href="http://hr.fieldworks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://hr.fieldworks.com</a>.</p>

          making a report, request, or participating in an investigation pertaining to these issues. Coercion,
          intimidation, discrimination, and retaliation are not tolerated at FieldWorks.</p>
          <p>Any employee who feels they have been subject to coercion, intimidation, discrimination, or retaliation should

          <h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>
          <p>Sexual harassment is illegal and a violation of FieldWorks policy. Sexual harassment occurs whenever unwelcome
          sexual conduct is made a term or condition of employment. This can happen in any one of two ways. First,
          sexual harassment occurs when unwelcome sexual conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
          with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.
          Second, sexual harassment occurs when a supervisor conditions the granting of an employment benefit upon the
          receipt of sexual favors from a subordinate or when a supervisor punishes the subordinate for refusing to
          submit to their request.</p>

          <p>Unwelcome sexual conduct that creates a sexually hostile environment can take a variety of forms. It can be
          verbal (sexual innuendo, suggestive comments, insults, threats, jokes about gender-specific traits, or sexual
          propositions), non-verbal (making suggestive or insulting noises, leering, whistling, or making obscene
          gestures, or physical (touching, pinching, or assault).</p>

          <p>FieldWorks policy is to investigate all complaints promptly and maintain confidentiality to the extent
          practical. Any employee who is found to have sexually harassed another employee or retaliated against an
          employee for making a sexual harassment complaint will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action up to and
          including termination.</p>

          <p>All employees and applicants are protected from coercion, intimidation, discrimination, and retaliation for
          making a report or participating in an investigation pertaining to these issues. Coercion, intimidation,
          discrimination, and retaliation are not tolerated at FieldWorks.</p>

          <p>If you believe that you (or any other employee) has been subjected to any form of sexual harassment you should
          promptly report such conduct to the Director or to the independent National HR Hotline at 888-398-0561 or
          <a href="http://hr.fieldworks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://hr.fieldworks.com</a>.</p> 

          <h2>Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure</h2>
          <p>Confidential Information shall be defined for the purpose of this policy as information (a) disclosed to the
          Employee by FieldWorks or other employees, consultants, officers or agents of FieldWorks or known or gathered
          by the Employee as a consequence of or through or in the course of performing services for FieldWorks and (b)
          not generally known to the public, about FieldWorks Clients, FieldWorks programs, activities, budget,
          strategies, plans and operations, including, but not limited to, information relating to field strategy,
          methods of operation or organization, contents of scripts for workers, press and other contact lists, identity
          of plans or administrative services, estimates, donor lists, donor history, personnel history, financial
          statements, accounting procedures and communications and organizing techniques, in whatsoever form, whether
          written, oral, electronic or otherwise, and in whatsoever media, whether in paper form, video or audio tape,
          disc or otherwise.</p>

          <p>Employee will not at any time, whether during the term of their employment by FieldWorks or after the
          termination thereof, directly or indirectly disclose any Confidential Information to any person, firm,
          organization, or corporation except for employees of FieldWorks with a need to know such Confidential
          Information.</p>

          <p>Employee will not at any time, whether during the term of their employment by FieldWorks or after the
          termination thereof, make use of any Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever other than as needed
          for the performance of services for FieldWorks by Employee.</p>

          <p>Employee acknowledges that all documents, words, scripts, forms, instruction and training materials and
          manuals and contact lists, information and data in their possession or custody, whether gathered by the
          Employee or any other person, and whether or not reduced to writing, or to any electronic or magnetic medium,
          relating to the business activities of FieldWorks are and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of
          FieldWorks.</p>

          <p>Employee will, upon the termination of their employment, irrespective of the time, manner, or cause of said
          termination, surrender to FieldWorks all Confidential Information in whatsoever form, written or otherwise and
          all other writings, materials and works, and all other information about FieldWorks donors, contacts, plans,
          projects, operations and activities, and all copies thereof, as well as any other property of FieldWorks.</p>

          <h2>Press and Social Media</h2>
          <p>You can never speak to the press or media about FieldWorks, FieldWorks Clients, or the campaign, even if the
          information requested is not confidential. If approached by press or media, you must decline to comment and
          then notify your director immediately.</p>

          <p>You are prohibited from disclosing Confidential Information including but not limited to photos, videos,
          audio, and text, on web logs and on social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube,
          Instagram, and others in the same way as you would be prohibited from disclosing Confidential Information in
          any other way.</p>

          <p>If you engage in posting on social media, even if done outside of FieldWorks time or offices, should be aware
          that any postings related to FieldWorks or any client of FieldWorks could have an adverse effect on the
          company. The risks include that information posted could be confidential or that people could view you as a
          spokesperson for the company.
          If you post on social media, you must observe the following guidelines:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Do not engage in blogging using any company resources without written permission.</li>
            <li>Refrain from referencing FieldWorks or any client of FieldWorks in any personal posting, tweet, or update.
              Do not represent yourself as a spokesperson for the company, intentionally or unintentionally. Identifying
              yourself as an employee has the ability to confer "insider" status to your thoughts and opinions. If you are
              an employee (not an independent contractor), you may list the company and your title on a “profile” page, but
              you may not list any details of the client or project.</li>
            <li>Information gained from work activities or company communications is confidential and should be treated
              accordingly. This information includes items which may not specifically mention the company but are related to
              the work you’re doing. (IE – “One of my canvassers got arrested today.”)</li>
            <li>Do not defame or otherwise discredit the company, its services, employees, clients, and vendors.</li>
            <li>Do not use the company's logos, trademarks, proprietary graphics, or photographs.</li>
            <li>Also, even if it doesn’t relate to the company or clients, USE COMMON SENSE. If you wouldn’t say it in a
              crowd of people, or have it published in a newspaper, you shouldn’t blog it.</li>
          </ol>
